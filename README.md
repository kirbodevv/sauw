# S.A.U.W. - Survival in an Unknown World

**S.A.U.W.** is a remake of my earlier game project[^1] developed between **2020–2022**.  
The original version was written in **Java** using the **LibGDX** framework.  
This new iteration is a full rewrite in **Rust**, powered by the **Bevy** game engine.

## How to build

To build executable file for your platform, run the following command:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

The compiled executable will appear in:

```path
target/release/
```
